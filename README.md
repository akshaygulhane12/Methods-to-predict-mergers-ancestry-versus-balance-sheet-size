# Methods-to-predict-mergers-ancestry-versus-balance-sheet-size
There are a range of factors that may contribute to the merger and acquisition processâ€”such as the regulatory environment, balance sheet size of a business, potential synergies across different agents, value of a brand, etc. However, we show that ancestry is the primary characteristic that captures the essential merger dynamics, and therefore synthesizes all the above factors. To illustrate this point, we considered a ranking test, to study both ancestry and balance sheet size as merger predictors, using data from the US banking industry.  In figure 1, US banks are ranked based on ancestry (red) or balance sheet size (blue). The bar chart shows the time-averaged number of mergers between banks (vertical axis) by ranking group (horizontal axis). Here, an increasing ranking group corresponds to a decrease in ancestor number or balance sheet size, as appropriate. For each ranking group, the number of acquisitions is averaged over a 3 year period, starting at each year between 1992 and 2013. As shown in figure 1, ranking banks by ancestry number led to monotonically decreasing merger activity from the high- to low-ranking groups, i.e. those banks ranked higher by ancestor number systematically
